# Panim
Like [***AnimOne***](https://github.com/The3DP/AnimOne), Panim brings code to life, but it’s built specifically for animating Python code. 
These animations are mainly edited in this repo's Codespace.

## Developing Typewriter Simulation

I'm focusing on crafting Python code for a typewriter effect. I plan to use 'sys.stdout.write' (or equivalent) along with 'time.sleep' to simulate character-by-character display, adjusting for speed. I will begin by importing the required modules, and then proceed with the implementation.
